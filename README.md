## Failure to Communicate Fully
In a workplace dominated by quick replies via text and email, details can be lost, overlooked or misunderstood.
Answering “yes” to a series of questions in an email isn’t clear.
Responding “OK” when asked if you can review a document does not address the question of where the document resides, what kind of review is requested, or when edits need to be returned.

__Solution__: Make email requests clear and detailed and make responses complete and comprehensive.
Before you press Send, ask yourself:
Did I answer each question in full?
Will the recipient have any outstanding questions after reading my email?

## Assuming Someone Else Has the Ball
When you’re part of a group brainstorming session, a group email or a group project, there’s always the potential to assume someone else has a task covered.
When everyone assumes someone else is handling things, the ball inevitably is dropped, which leads to finger-pointing, blame and missed deadlines.

__Solution__: In any group dynamic, there needs to be a point person to set and clarify roles at the close of discussion or debate.
A group email that clarifies who is doing what and when streamlines group initiatives.

## Inarticulate Communication
Self-editing is a good business technique to learn in both written and verbal forms.
Failure to consider what you are about to write or say can lead to a breakdown in communication, either because you are not fully articulating your thoughts or because you react without thinking, which leads to hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

__Solution__: Before you press Send, check for content, spelling, grammar and validity.
Then, check your tone to ensure the recipient can't misconstrue your words.
When speaking in a heated environment, choose your words carefully and run them through your mental filter at least once before saying them out loud.

## Being Unprepared
If you’re late for a meeting or approaching a deadline, and you are unprepared, you may be tempted to wing it.
When you are unprepared, mistakes, misunderstandings, and even the misdirection of a project or task can occur.

__Solution__: Be organized and prepared. If you are not, it’s better to admit you need more time than to throw an idea against the wall and hope it sticks.

## Using the Wrong Communication Tool
There are times when an email is appropriate and other times when a phone call or in-person meeting is more suitable.
Misjudging the situation and picking the wrong tool can lead to a breakdown in communication and create confusion, misunderstanding and hurt feelings.

__Solution__: If you exchange nonsensitive information every day, email is fine.
If you’re trying to untangle a sticky situation rife with misinformation, a phone call or Skype session allows for a more effective back-and-forth exchange.
If you’re delivering bad news or having a serious or contentious debate, an in-person approach is the best choice.
It allows you to read body language, gauge temperament and make personal contact.

## Saying Too Much
Sometimes we overshare when we speak before we think.
Other times, we gossip and exchange inappropriate information.
Sometimes sloppiness results in oversharing or releasing personal or sensitive information – think of a scenario in which you accidentally hit “reply to all” or “forward” in an email conversation in which you and a colleague are talking in derogatory terms about a customer.

__Solution__: Emphasize the need for confidentiality in the workplace, hold sensitive meetings behind closed doors, refrain from putting highly confidential or sensitive information in email, and stop gossip in its tracks.

## Listen
It’s The Golden Rule
Listening skills are crucial to effectively communicating and understanding what is being shared.
Employees and managers who cannot listen will miss key information or won’t know what is happening.

__Solution__:Ensure that all employees can share their voice with management and that you’re not just exposed to ideas from your “inner circle”.
Gaining feedback from your employees is a key driver for employee engagement, productivity, morale, and retention.

## Communication Is A Two Way Street
The manager should not be the one to do all the talking.
It is vital to build and foster two-way relationships with your team. 

__Solution__: Engage employees in an active dialogue and do it on a regular basis.

## One On One Meetings Are Vital
Gallup reported that 70% of the discrepancies in employee engagement was solely caused by the actions or in actions of a manager.
Therefore, one-on-one meetings can help to avoid workplace communication problems.
By having one-on-one meetings you provide your employees with a safe and positive workplace environment where employees feel heard.
Forbes research shows that by having an open-door policy, you are able to gain “accessibility as a manager, to encourage an open flow of communication, to gain fast access to important or just happening situations or information and to maintain closer working relationships with employees”.

Streamlined and effective communications start from the top down.
If you don’t already have a best-practices communications policy in place, create one and use it for orientation and staff training events.
Also, consider that sometimes a problem that appears to the result of poor communication could be ineffective business practices, poor organization or lackluster time management skills.
Before blaming communication problems, assess the other causes for a breakdown in effective operations.
